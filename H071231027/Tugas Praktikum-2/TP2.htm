    <p>

      I am Kevin Ardhana, an undergraduate student in the Information Systems program at Universitas Hasanuddin, Faculty
      of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. With a passion for IT and entrepreneurship, I have honed my skills through
      various leadership and project experiences.

      I led the KPMP MIPA science community and headed the Skills Division at Pandu Digital. Additionally, I achieved
      2nd place in the Young Entrepreneurship competition by Ruangguru. My portfolio includes designing the AgroVerify
      app in a UI/UX competition and contributing to various tech projects such as web and app development, data
      analysis, and podcast operations.

      I am actively involved in the startup ecosystem and aspire to further grow as a youthpreneur. Currently, I also
      work part-time as a blogger, sharing insights on tech and innovation.

      Let me know if you’d like to adjust any details!
